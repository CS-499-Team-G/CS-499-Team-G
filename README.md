## Project Description

This is a website for a Trucking Company Management System. Information about vehicle maintenance, shipment statuses, shipment manifests, and payrolls can be viewed by users of the system on demand.

## PLEASE CONTACT DANT'E PEAKS (DRP0012@UAH.EDU) WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO ACCESS THE WEBSITE. IT IS HOSTED LOCALLY

## Interacting with the Website

- The user can log in on any Windows computer to this website, and, using credentials provided by the authors of the website, the user can input a username and password to gain access to the other pages of the website.
- Once logged in, the user can choose one of 5 reports to pull from the database.
- After choosing a report, clicking the "Generate Report" button will pull the data from the database and display it in a table.
  - Most items can be sorted by clicking the heading cell of that column.
  - For the Incoming Shipments and Outgoing Shipments specifically, the rightmost "Items" column cells can be interacted with by clicking the text to get more information on the items contained within each shipment entity.
- The hamburger menu in the top right of the main webpage can be interacted with by clicking on it. Doing so will reveal a pop-down menu that will allow the user to choose from one of three options: Adding shipment data, creating user accounts, and logging out of the system.
- Clicking "Add Shipment" will bring the user to a form that must be entirely filled out to be submitted. Populate the form with shipment data, and then submit the results to add a new shipment to the database.
- Clicking "Create a User" will bring the user to a form that will allow for the creation of a new user entity.
- Clicking "Log Out" will bring the user back to the login page.
